# FantasticHUD-FurtherFromCenter-

Credit to steam user "dreams in celluloid" for coming
up with this idea.

Once you download the HUD, there will be two files,
the one will have "4x3" in brackets and the other will have "16x9"
these are for the aspect ratios, just drag and drop the one with the
corresponding aspect ratio to:
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom"
Then you should be set (:

If the HUD looks wierd try the other HUD file.

I don't know if this HUD will work on MacOS, or Linux, so try at your own risk.
